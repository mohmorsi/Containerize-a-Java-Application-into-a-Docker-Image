## Introduction
A *container* simply put packages up all the code and dependencies in order in a "canister", in order for the application to run smoothly in any computing environment. A **Docker container image** is a standalone executable that includes the application's code, system libraries and tools as well as its settings. Pretty neat!

## Usage
For this demonstration, I will be using a simple Java application named `Account.java` that creates two bank account objects and then sets and prints their balances.
